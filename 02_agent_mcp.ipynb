The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right. The left one is situated both on the [[moraine]] plateau ({{convert|10|to|25|m|abbr=on}} above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=on}} above Vistula level).

The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground [[depression (geology)|depressions]] with water systems coming from the old Vistula&nbsp;\\u2013 riverbed. They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the Vistula plain terraces (flooded as well as formerly flooded), and only a small part is a not-so-visible moraine escarpment.

In the years 1990\\u20131994, the city mayor of Warsaw was elected by the [[city council]].<ref name=\\\"djordjevic\\\"/>\\n\\nA controversial reform was introduced in 1994, which transformed the city into a loose municipal union of several gminas, dominated by one of them, the gmina Centrum encompassing the entire inner city. During this period, the mayor of gmina Centrum who was elected by its council was automatically designated as the city mayor of Warsaw, in spite of representing only a fraction of the population of the city. The city was becoming increasingly unmanageable, especially after the administrative reform of Poland in 1999 which further complicated the local government structure of Warsaw. In 2002, the new ''Warsaw Act'' of the Polish parliament restored Warsaw as a single urban gmina with the status of a city with powiat rights, led by a unified local government. At the same time, a significant reform was implemented in all Polish municipal governments, introducing direct elections of the w\\u00f3jt/town mayor/city mayor in all Polish gminas.<ref name=\\\"djordjevic\\\"/> The first city mayor of Warsaw elected according to these rules was [[Lech Kaczy\\u0144ski]], who however resigned ahead of term when he was elected [[President of Poland|President of Polish Republic]] in 2005.\\n\\nWarsaw has thereafter remained an [[urban gmina]] with the status of a [[city with powiat rights]].<ref name=\\\"admin\\\"/> [[Legislature|Legislative power]] in Warsaw is vested in a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Warsaw City Council]] (''Rada Miasta''), which comprises 60 members.<ref name=\\\"admin\\\"/> Council members are elected directly every five years (since [[2018 Polish local elections|2018 election]]). Like most legislative bodies, the city council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government.<ref name=\\\"admin\\\"/> The city mayor exercises the executive power in the city, being the superior of all unelected municipal- or county-level officials and other employees and supervising all subsidiary entities of the city. The incumbent [[List of city mayors of Warsaw|city mayor of Warsaw]] is [[Rafa\\u0142 Trzaskowski]].\\n\\nThe ''Warsaw Act'' imposes a mandatory division into 18 auxiliary units called ''dzielnica'' (district) on the city. In spite of remaining an integral part of the city as an entity, the districts have a degree of autonomy legally guaranteed through a form of an own local self-government exercising some powers devolved by law from the city. They have the duty to assist the city mayor and the City Council in their tasks, such as supervising some municipal companies, city-owned property or schools. Each of the 18 city districts has an own council (''rada dzielnicy'')<ref name=\\\"admin\\\"/> which elects an executive board (''zarz\\u0105d dzielnicy'') headed by a district mayor (''burmistrz dzielnicy''), the latter elected by the council among several candidates nominated by the city mayor of Warsaw among the council's members.\\n\\n===Districts===\\n{|class=\\\"wikitable sortable floatright\\\" style=\\\"font-size:90%;\\\"\\n|-\\n!District||Population||Area\\n|-\\n| [[Mokot\\u00f3w]]||align = right|225,496||{{convert|35.42|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n|[[Praga Po\\u0142udnie]]||align=right|186,623||{{convert|22.38|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Bia\\u0142o\\u0142\\u0119ka]]||align = right|154,596||{{convert|73.00|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Ursyn\\u00f3w]]||align = right|151,345||{{convert|43.79|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Wola]]||align = right|150,977||{{convert|19.26|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Bielany]]||align = right|132,803||{{convert|32.34|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Bemowo]]||align = right|128,995||{{convert|24.95|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Targ\\u00f3wek]]||align = right|123,957||{{convert|24.33|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n|[[\\u015ar\\u00f3dmie\\u015bcie, Warsaw|\\u015ar\\u00f3dmie\\u015bcie]]||align=right|101,030||{{convert|15.57|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Wawer]]||align = right|86,854||{{convert|79.71|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Ochota]]||align = right|80,587||{{convert|9.72|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n|[[Ursus, Warsaw|Ursus]]||align=right|67,814||{{convert|9.35|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n|[[Praga P\\u00f3\\u0142noc]]||align=right|60,387||{{convert|11.31|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[\\u017boliborz]]||align = right|58,724||{{convert|8.47|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Wilan\\u00f3w]]||align = right|51,603||{{convert|36.73|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[W\\u0142ochy]]||align = right|49,332||{{convert|28.63|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Weso\\u0142a]]||align = right|26,454||{{convert|22.94|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| [[Rembert\\u00f3w]]||align = right|24,768||{{convert|19.30|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|-\\n| '''Total'''||align = right|1,862,345<ref name=\\\"raport o stanie miasta 2022\\\">{{cite web |url=https://um.warszawa.pl/documents/56602/0/Raport+o+stanie+miasta+22_10_lipca.pdf/d05cd24e-c9f1-40ea-f35c-7a19ecee75b1?t=1689054386540|title=Raport o stanie miasta Warszawa 2022. |publisher=Warsaw City Hall |website=um.warszawa.pl |access-date=21 January 2024 |language=pl}}</ref>||{{convert|521.81|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\\n|}\\n{{Warsaw districts}}\\n{{clear}}\\n\\nAs a result, Warsaw has thereafter continued as an [[urban gmina]] holding status of a [[city with powiat rights]], divided into 18 districts (''dzielnica''),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e-warsaw.pl/images/mapa_dzielnice.gif |title=WarsawTour \\u2013 Official Tourist Portal of Warsaw |first=Sto\\u0142eczne Biuro |last=Turystyki |access-date=6 February 2017 |archive-date=13 April 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413200754/http://www.e-warsaw.pl/images/mapa_dzielnice.gif |url-status=dead}}</ref> auxiliary municipal units established within the city as an entity as its integral parts, though with some limited powers devolved from the city to their own local self-governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/miasto/dzielnice.htm |title=Dzielnice |work=um.warszawa.pl |access-date=11 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701114815/http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/miasto/dzielnice.htm |archive-date=1 July 2008 |language=pl |url-status=dead}}</ref> Each of the districts is customarily subdivided into several neighbourhoods lacking any meaningful legal or administrative powers.
